- JUnit 5 migration: deleted 54 self-verifying tests, replaced with parameterized tests.
- Parallelized test execution with 8 forked JVMs.
- Test grouping by level: merged headless tests sharing the same level load into groups
  (EHZ1: 4→1, ARZ1: 3→1, CNZ1: 3→1, HTZ1: 2→1, AIZ1: 2→1, GHZ1: 6→1), eliminating 14 redundant
  level loads.
- Added TODO/FIXME coverage tests with disassembly validation.

### Cross-Game Feature Donation

Implemented cross-game feature donation system: a donor game (S2 or S3K) provides player sprites,
spindash dust, physics, palettes, and SFX while the base game (e.g. S1) handles levels, collision,
objects, and music. Enabled via `CROSS_GAME_FEATURES_ENABLED` and `CROSS_GAME_SOURCE` config keys.

- `CrossGameFeatureProvider` singleton: opens donor ROM as secondary ROM (no module detection
  side-effect), creates game-specific art loaders (`Sonic2PlayerArt`/`Sonic3kPlayerArt`,
  `Sonic2DustArt`), builds hybrid `PhysicsFeatureSet` (spindash from donor, everything else S1),
  loads donor character palette, initializes donor audio.
- `RenderContext` palette isolation: base game occupies palette lines 0-3, each donor gets its own
  block of 4 lines (4-7, 8-11, etc.) via static registry with `getOrCreateDonor()`.
  `uploadDonorPalettes()` pushes donor palettes to GPU. `getDonorContexts()` for iteration.
- `GameId` enum with `fromCode()` for type-safe donor identification.
- `RomManager.getSecondaryRom()` opens donor ROM without triggering game module detection.
- `LevelManager` art loading paths (`initPlayerSpriteArt`, `initSpindashDust`, `initTailsTails`)
  check `CrossGameFeatureProvider.isActive()` and delegate to donor art providers, attaching
  donor `RenderContext` to each `PlayerSpriteRenderer`.
- `Engine` initialization gates sidekick spawning on `GameModule.supportsSidekick()` or
  `CrossGameFeatureProvider.isActive()`, with cleanup on shutdown.
- GPU palette texture dynamically resized via `RenderContext.getTotalPaletteLines()`. All shaders
  (`shader_the_hedgehog`, `shader_tilemap`, `shader_water`, `shader_sprite_priority`,
  `shader_instanced_priority`, `shader_cnz_slots`) updated from hardcoded `/4.0` to
  `/TotalPaletteLines` uniform.
- Underwater palette derivation for donor sprites:
  - `RenderContext.deriveUnderwaterPalette()` synthesizes donor underwater colors using the base
    game's global average per-channel color shift ratio (not per-index, which would mismatch
    palette layouts across games).
  - `GraphicsManager.cacheUnderwaterPaletteTexture()` extended to populate donor palette rows
    automatically from the base game's normal-to-underwater shift.
- Donor SMPS driver config for correct SFX playback:
  - `SmpsSequencerConfig` threaded through `AudioManager.registerDonorLoader()` (4-arg overload),
    stored per donor game in `donorConfigs` map.
  - `AudioBackend.playSfxSmps()` 4-arg overload accepting explicit config; `LWJGLAudioBackend`
    uses donor config when provided, falling back to base game config.
  - `CrossGameFeatureProvider.initializeDonorAudio()` passes `donorProfile.getSequencerConfig()`.
- Donor audio overlay in `AudioManager`: `donorLoaders`, `donorDacData`, `donorSoundBindings` maps;
  `playSfx()` falls through to donor path when base game sound map has no entry.
- S3K Tails tail appendage support: `CrossGameFeatureProvider.hasSeparateTailsTailArt()` and
  `loadTailsTailArt()` delegate to donor's `Sonic3kPlayerArt` for separate Obj05 tail art.
  `LevelManager.initTailsTails()` checks donor game module when cross-game is active, selecting
  correct art loading path and `ANI_SELECTION_S3K` animation tables.
- SFX re-trigger fix in `SmpsDriver`: re-triggering the same SFX ID now replaces the old sequencer
  instead of competing for the same FM/PSG channels (prevents priority lock ping-pong with S1/S2
  jump SFX priority 0x80).
- Tests: `TestRenderContext` (9 tests covering palette isolation, line allocation, reset,
  underwater palette derivation), `TestDonorAudioRouting` (donor SFX routing and sequencer config),
  `TestGameId`, `TestHybridPhysicsFeatureSet`, `TestSidekickGating`.

### Master Title Screen

- Implemented `MasterTitleScreen` (404 lines): engine-wide title screen displayed on startup before
  entering game-specific title flow. PNG-based background, animated clouds, title emblem, and game
  selection text rendered via `TexturedQuadRenderer` and `PixelFont`.
- New rendering infrastructure: `PngTextureLoader` (85 lines), `TexturedQuadRenderer` (139 lines),
  `PixelFont` (144 lines), `shader_rgba_texture` vertex/fragment shaders.
- Configurable via `TITLE_SCREEN_ON_STARTUP` config key (default: enabled).

### Sonic 1 Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed Sonic spawning 5px underneath terrain on level reset by restoring standing radii in
  `AbstractPlayableSprite` respawn path (ROM: `Obj01_Init` unconditionally sets `y_radius=$13`).
- Object collision fixes: `ObjectManager` solid overlap test now always uses `airHalfHeight`
  matching ROM behaviour (d3 is overwritten by playerYRadius before read). Added
  `Sonic1ButtonObjectInstance` and `Sonic1MzBrickObjectInstance` collision support.
  `TestHeadlessSonic1ObjectCollision` (291 lines) regression test added.
- Fixed edge balance mode for S1 (single balance state, force face edge) while preserving S2's
  4-state extended balance. `PhysicsFeatureSet.extendedEdgeBalance` gates behaviour.
  `TestEdgeBalance` (91 lines) and `TestHeadlessSonic1EdgeBalance` (369 lines) added.
- Fixed MZ2 push block: longer blocks no longer get pushed "out of the way" when Sonic pushes them
  against walls. `SolidContact` improvements. `TestHeadlessMZ2PushBlockGap` (132 lines) added.
- SBZ fixes: Flamethrower positioning corrected for vflip/hflip variants. StomperDoor objects fixed.
  Junction now locks the player correctly. SBZ3 water oscillation implemented.
- LZ fixes: Wind tunnels now play correct player animation. Breakable poles play correct animation.
  Water splash effect implemented (`Sonic1SplashObjectInstance`).
- Demo playback now sent to objects (`AbstractPlayableSprite` demo input routing).
- Push stability fixes for solid objects. `TestHeadlessSonic1PushStability` (220 lines) added.
- Outro/credits improvements (`Sonic1CreditsManager`, `FadeManager` enhancements).
- `TestSbz1CreditsDemoBug` (162 lines) and `TestS1FlamethrowerObjectRendering` (58 lines) added.
- S1 "fast" mode SMPS sequencer support.
- S1 outro improvements: disable control on outro, change 'back to main menu' key.
- S1 ending sequence flowers fix.
- S1 object collision fixes.

### Sonic 2 Fixes

- Fixed badnik palette lines (Spiny now uses palette line 1 matching `make_art_tile`), signpost
  frame order corrected to match `obj0D_a.asm` ROM mapping order, CPZ stair block / MTZ platform
  art sheet rebuilt with hand-crafted mappings (ROM mappings reference level art tiles).
- Swinging platform art loading fix for non-S2 games.
- S2 ending cutscene parity: DEZ white fade (not black), star field background, pilot visibility,
  BG scroll compensation, DPLC player sprites, tornado visibility, falling timing.
- Prevented DEZ Robot despawn during defeat ending sequence.
- Fixed DEZ boss visual and collision issues (multiple passes).
- Fixed S2 credits visual accuracy: ROM-correct font, mappings, and player detection.
- Fixed S2 `Sonic2LevelEventManager` zone constants alignment with `ZoneRegistry`.

### Physics and Collision Fixes

- Fixed solid object edge jitter: `SolidContacts` snaps player to resolved edge on static solids
  to prevent subpixel accumulation. Push-driven objects opt in to ROM-style subpixel preservation
  via `SolidObjectProvider.preservesEdgeSubpixelMotion()`.
- S1 slope crest sensor guard: prefer floor-class probe over wall-class probe at crest transitions,
  preventing one-frame wall/air mode flips.
  `TestHeadlessStaticObjectPushStability` (208 lines) and
  `TestSonic1GhzSlopeTopDiagnostic` (519 lines) added.
- Sonic no longer jumps if the player holds jump while airborne via a non-jump (spring, slope
  launch, etc.).
- Various physics tweaks aimed at S1: physics modifiers cleanup, `FadeManager` fade-to-black
  transitions no longer flash back to "off" briefly before fade-in begins.
- Fixed results screen rendering issue for both S1 and S2.

### Package Rename

- Renamed root package from `uk.co.jamesj999.sonic` to `com.openggf` across the entire codebase.
  All source files, test files, and references updated.

### Profile-Driven Level Loading

- Introduced `LevelInitProfile` abstraction with `InitStep` and `StaticFixup` primitives for
  declarative, ROM-aligned level loading.
- Implemented per-game profiles (`Sonic1LevelInitProfile`, `Sonic2LevelInitProfile`,
  `Sonic3kLevelInitProfile`) with 13 finer-grained ROM-aligned steps each.
- `LevelLoadContext` provides shared state across load steps.
- `LevelManager.loadLevel()` routed through profile steps; old fallback path removed.
- Per-step timing and logging for load diagnostics.
- Profile-driven teardown and per-test reset replaces `TestEnvironment` and `GameContext.forTesting()`.
- `CHARACTER_APPEAR` phase uses `Map_Sonic`/`Map_Tails` Float2 animation.

### Testability Refactor

- `GameContext` holder with `production()` and `forTesting()` factories for singleton lifecycle.
- `SharedLevel` for reusable level loading across test classes.
- `HeadlessTestFixture` builder pattern for test setup, with 14 test classes converted.

### Physics Engine

#### Core Physics Rewrite
- Complete physics rewrite in `PlayableSpriteMovement` (1,814 lines, replacing 1,134-line predecessor)
- Movement modes now explicitly mirror ROM state machine: `Obj01_MdNormal` (ground walking), `Obj01_MdRoll` (ground rolling), `Obj01_MdAir`/`MdJump` (airborne)
- ROM-accurate slope resistance/repulsion formulas with correct angle offset (0x20) and mask (0xC0)
- Slope repel minimum speed threshold (0x280) matching ROM `Sonic_SlopeRepel`
- Rolling physics: dedicated roll deceleration (0x20), controlled roll constants, minimum start roll speed gating
- Spindash fully reimplemented using ROM speed table (`s2.asm:37294`) indexed by `spindash_counter >> 8`
- Spindash counter charging/decay logic matching ROM `Sonic_UpdateSpindash`
- Fixed subpixel accuracy: subpixels were not being used correctly in velocity/position calculations
- Near-apex air drag implemented (when -1024 <= ySpeed < 0), matching ROM `Sonic_MdJump` behaviour
- Upward velocity cap added at -0xFC0
- Roll height adjustment fixed (5px to 10px) for all roll-mode transitions, preventing visual "fall" on transition
- ROM-identical angle/quadrant selection table in `TrigLookupTable` (256 entries from `misc/angles.bin`)
- `calcAngle()` method exactly matching ROM `CalcAngle` routine (s2.asm:4033-4076)
- Jump angle calculation and slope angle assist/repel gating adjustments

#### Player Mechanics
- Pinball mode flag (`pinballMode`) preventing rolling from being cleared on landing; gives boost instead of stopping at speed 0. Used by CNZ tubes, blue balls, launcher springs. Preserved through launcher spring bounces
- Ledge balance animation with 4 balance states matching ROM (BALANCE through BALANCE4) based on proximity and facing direction (s2.asm:36246-36373)
- Look up/down delay counter (`lookDelayCounter`) matching ROM `Sonic_Look_delay_counter` timing
- Spring control lock fixed to only apply when grounded (was incorrectly locking controls in air)
- Run animation starts the moment left/right are pressed
- Three distinct control lock types matching ROM: `objectControlled` (blocks all input), `moveLocked` (blocks directional but allows jump), `springing` (blocks grounded directional)
- Signpost walk-off fix: control lock no longer cancels forced input, allowing Sonic to properly walk off-screen after act end
- Position history buffer (64 entries) for camera lag and spindash compensation

#### Collision System
- New unified `CollisionSystem` (214 lines) orchestrating a 3-phase pipeline:
  1. Terrain probes (ground/ceiling/wall sensors via `TerrainCollisionManager`)
  2. Solid object resolution (platforms, moving solids via `ObjectManager.SolidContacts`)
  3. Post-resolution adjustments (ground mode, headroom checks)
- Supports trace recording via `CollisionTrace` interface for debugging and testing
- `GroundSensor` rewrite (437 lines): separated vertical scanning (floor/ceiling) from horizontal scanning (walls), ROM-accurate negative metric handling, full-tile edge detection with previous-tile lookback, horizontal wall scanning with regress/extend states
- Collision order fix: solid objects now processed before terrain, preventing objects from being overridden
- Sensor adjustment timing changed to earlier in the tick
- Collision path reset on level switch to prevent falling through levels on wrong layer
- Ceiling collision improvements: better ceiling sensors on walls/ceilings, angle-based landing detection, ceiling mode (0x80) correctly adjusts only Y velocity
- Wall pushing fix
- Solid object landing now resets ground mode and angle (matching solid tile landing)
- New `ObjectTerrainUtils` (296 lines) for game object terrain collision (floor, ceiling, left wall, right wall), mirroring ROM `ObjCheckFloorDist`

### Camera

- Complete vertical scroll rewrite matching ROM behaviour:
  - Y position bias system (`Camera_Y_pos_bias`) with default value of 96
  - Look up bias (200) with gradual 2px/frame increment
  - Look down bias (8) with gradual 2px/frame decrement
  - Bias easing back to default at 2px/frame
  - Grounded scroll speed cap: 2px (looking), 6px (normal), 16px (fast, inertia >= 0x800)
- Airborne camera uses +/-32px window around current bias matching ROM `ScrollVerti` airborne path
- Horizontal scroll delay (`horizScrollDelayFrames`) replaces old `framesBehind` system. Matches ROM where `ScrollHoriz` checks `Horiz_scroll_delay_val` but `ScrollVerti` does not
- Rolling height compensation: camera subtracts 5px from Y delta when rolling (1px for Tails)
- Spindash camera fixed to use horizontal scroll delay rather than full camera freeze
- Screen shake system: `shakeOffsetX`/`shakeOffsetY` with `getXWithShake()`/`getYWithShake()` for rendering (used by HTZ earthquake)
- Boundary clamping to `minX`/`minY` (was only clamping to 0)
- Full freeze (death/cutscenes) now separate from horizontal scroll delay

### Water System

- Complete `WaterSystem` (462 lines): water level loaded from ROM at correct height, water oscillation in CPZ2 via `OscillationManager`, water surface sprites rendering in front of solid tiles
- `WaterSurfaceManager` (282 lines) for surface sprite management
- Water surface sprites appear for CPZ2, ARZ1, and ARZ2

#### GPU Rendering Pipeline
- **Pattern atlas system**: all 8x8 tile patterns uploaded to a single GPU texture (`PatternAtlas`, 326 lines) with multi-atlas fallback and buffer pooling
- **GPU tilemap renderer** (`TilemapGpuRenderer`, 198 lines): dedicated `TilemapShaderProgram` (172 lines) and `TilemapTexture` (78 lines) for GPU-side tile lookup. Covers background, water, and foreground layers. Configurable fallback to CPU rendering

- `ENV_QUIET` threshold: when envelope exceeds threshold, operator output forced to 0, causing feedback buffer to naturally decay (matching real hardware)
- SSG-EG (SSG envelope generator) support
- Phase generator detune overflow matching Nemesis-verified real hardware behaviour (DT_BITS = 17)
- Internal sample rate output: YM2612 can output at CLOCK/144 (~53267 Hz) with proper band-limited resampling via `BlipDeltaBuffer` (330 lines) and `BlipResampler` (200 lines)
- Fixed operator routing order and TL position in voice format
- Fixed voice format parsing that was causing corruption and muted instruments
- Fixed low output volume
- Multiple rounds of accuracy improvements (5+ commits)

#### PSG (SN76489)
- New Experimental (Off by Default) PSG implementation with anti-aliasing

- Clock divider fixed to 32.0, Noise Mode 3 corrected
- Clock speed and period calculation fixed
- Extensive spindash release SFX fixes (PSG modulation, note-off, tone bleed, noise channel)
- Default to original PSG after noise channel issues, keeping GPGX as reference

#### SMPS Driver
- Fixed frequency wrapping for high notes
- Fixed E7 command handling
- Fixed octave shifts during modulation/detune
- Fixed fill/gate time logic causing audio desync
- Fixed missing noise channel
- Refactored driver locking to prevent concurrent modification between SFX and music
- `SmpsSequencerConfig` abstraction: configurable per-game (Sonic 1 vs Sonic 2 differences in instrument loading, pitch offsets, noise channel handling)
- Sonic 1 SMPS driver accuracy fixes:
  - PSG envelope 1-based indexing: S1 `subq.w #1,d0` before table lookup; VoiceIndex=0 means no envelope
  - FM voice operator order conversion: S1 (Op4,Op3,Op2,Op1) swapped to engine's S2 format (Op4,Op2,Op3,Op1) on load
  - PC-relative pointer addressing: S1 F6/F7/F8 commands use `dc.w loc-*-1` offsets vs S2 absolute Z80 addresses
  - TIMEOUT tempo mode: S1 uses countdown-based tempo (extend durations on wrap) vs S2 accumulator overflow
  - PSG base note: S1 PSGSetFreq subtracts 0x81 (table starts at C), so `getPsgBaseNoteOffset()` returns 0
  - SFX tempo bypass: S1 SFX have normalTempo=0; skip duration extension in TIMEOUT mode when sfxMode=true
  - First-frame tempo processing matching S1 DOTEMPO behaviour

#### Sound Effects and Music
- Fixed extra life music restore (multiple playbacks no longer break original music)

#### Audio Backend
- Migrated from JOAL to LWJGL OpenAL (`LWJGLAudioBackend`, 427 lines). Includes `WavDecoder` for WAV file support
- Fixed audio quality degradation in LWJGL backend
- Audio latency reduced to 16ms (one frame)

## v0.2.20260117

Improvements and fixes across the board. Special stages are now implemented, feature complete with
a few known issues. Physics have been improved, parallax backgrounds implemented and complete for
EHZ, CPZ, ARZ and MCZ. Some sound improvements, title cards, level 'outros' etc.

## v0.1.20260110

Now vaguely resembles the actual Sonic 2 game. Real collision and graphics data is loaded from the
Sonic 2 ROM and rendered on screen. The majority of the physics are in place, although it is far
from perfect. A system for loading game objects has been created, along with an implementation for
most of the objects and Badniks in Emerald Hill Zone. Rings are implemented, life and score tracking
is implemented. SoundFX and music are implemented. Everything has room for improvement, but this
now resembles a playable game.

## V0.05 (2015-04-09)

Little more than a tech demo. Sonic is able to run and jump and collide with terrain in a reasonably
correct way. No graphics have yet been implemented so it's a moving white box on a black background.

## V0.01 (Pre-Alpha) (Unreleased; first documented 2013-05-22)

A moving black box. This version will be complete when we have an unskinned box that can traverse
terrain in the same way Sonic would in the original game.
