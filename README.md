# OpenGGF - The Open-Source Java-Based Speedy Erinaceidae Engine

> This project is a work in progress. For the current state, please see the latest version in the
> Releases section of this document.

## Introduction

This Java-based Sonic the Hedgehog game engine aims to fully and faithfully recreate the original
physics of the Sonic The Hedgehog games for Sega Mega Drive (Genesis). It will be capable of loading
the game data from the original ROMs of the games and providing a pixel-perfect gameplay experience
of the original games. It will also provide more modern features, such as a level editor, and an
open framework allowing for modding and customisation.

## Configuration

The engine currently makes limited use of `config.json` to hold some basic configurations. Change
these at your own risk.

## Controls

> Currently, only keyboard controls are supported.

## Releases

### v0.4 (Unreleased)

A release-sized update focused on expanding playable coverage and parity.

- **Master title screen** implemented: engine-wide PNG-based title screen with animated clouds, game
  selection, and pixel font renderer. Displayed on startup before entering game-specific title flow.
- **Sonic 1** has moved from initial support to broad gameplay coverage: title screen flow, special
  stages, major per-zone event scripting, extensive object and badnik additions, multiple boss
  implementations (GHZ, MZ, SYZ, LZ, SLZ, FZ), Labyrinth water/drowning/splash behaviour,
  ending/credits work, SBZ object and demo playback fixes, edge balance and push block collision
  corrections, and slope crest sensor guard.
- **Sonic 2** adds title screen support, major object passes for MTZ/SCZ/WFZ/OOZ, MCZ boss work,
  expanded per-zone event architecture, and signpost/badnik palette/stair block art fixes.
- **Sonic 3&K** sees major AIZ progress including intro cutscene systems, hollow tree and vine
  traversal parity work, miniboss object set bring-up, initial badnik implementations, shield/PLC
  integration fixes, and related regressions/tests.
- **Cross-game feature donation** implemented: a donor game (S2 or S3K) can provide player sprites,
  spindash dust, physics, palettes, and SFX while the base game handles levels, collision, objects,
  and music. Includes `CrossGameFeatureProvider`, `RenderContext` palette isolation (donor sprites
  render on dedicated palette lines 4+), underwater palette derivation for donor sprites, donor SMPS
  driver config for correct SFX playback, S3K Tails tail appendage/animation support, hybrid physics
  feature set, donor audio registration with per-game sequencer config, and dynamic palette texture
  resizing across all GPU shaders.
- **Per-game physics** and Super Sonic state/control flow (implemented for S2, stubbed for S3K).
- **Engine fixes:** solid object edge jitter fix, S1 slope crest sensor guard, jump-while-airborne
  guard, fade transition flash fix, results screen rendering fix.
- PLC/art-loader refactors, RomOffsetFinder/ObjectDiscoveryTool enhancements, configuration
  documentation, and broad audio/stability/performance hardening.

See CHANGELOG.md for full details.

### v0.3.20260206

A massive release covering 366 commits across every major subsystem.

- **Tails** (Miles Prower) is now a playable character with ROM-accurate CPU AI follower behaviour,
  input replay, flight, and configurable sidekick toggle.
- **Multi-game architecture:** The engine has been refactored to support multiple games via a
  provider-based abstraction layer, with initial Sonic 1 ROM support (level select, title cards, HUD,
  audio with S1-specific SMPS driver configuration) alongside the existing Sonic 2 support.
- **Physics:** The physics engine has been completely rewritten to match ROM behaviour.
- **Bosses and objects:** Boss fights are implemented for 5 zones (EHZ, CPZ, HTZ, CNZ, ARZ), along
  with 15+ new badniks and 50+ new game objects spanning all implemented zones.
- **Water:** A full water system with drowning mechanics is in place for CPZ and ARZ.
- **Graphics:** The graphics backend has been migrated from JOGL to LWJGL with a GPU-accelerated
  rendering pipeline (pattern atlas, tilemap shader, instanced sprite batching, priority FBOs).
- **Audio:** Major accuracy improvements to YM2612 FM synthesis (based on Genesis-Plus-GX reference)
  and the SMPS driver.
- **Infrastructure:** Per-game ROM configuration, a HeadlessTestRunner for physics integration
  testing, visual and audio regression test suites, a multi-game test annotation framework, GraalVM
  native build support, and significant performance optimisations throughout.

See CHANGELOG.md for full details.

### v0.2.20260117

Improvements and fixes across the board. Special stages are now implemented, feature complete with a
few known issues. Physics have been improved, parallax backgrounds implemented and complete for EHZ,
CPZ, ARZ and MCZ. Some sound improvements, title cards, level outros, etc.

### v0.1.20260110

Now vaguely resembles the actual Sonic 2 game. Real collision and graphics data is loaded from the
Sonic 2 ROM and rendered on screen. The majority of the physics are in place, although it is far
from perfect. A system for loading game objects has been created, along with an implementation for
most of the objects and badniks in Emerald Hill Zone. Rings are implemented, life and score tracking
is implemented. SFX and music are implemented. Everything has room for improvement, but this now
resembles a playable game.

### v0.05 (2015-04-09)

Little more than a tech demo. Sonic is able to run and jump and collide with terrain in a reasonably
correct way. No graphics have yet been implemented so it's a moving white box on a black background.

### v0.01 (Pre-Alpha, first documented 2013-05-22)

A moving black box. This version will be complete when we have an unskinned box that can traverse
terrain in the same way Sonic would in the original game.
